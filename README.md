# eComma
Scripts for analyzing reader comments from the social reading tool eComma (https://ecomma.coerll.utexas.edu/)

eComma is used by the French department at UT Austin to allow beginning French students to collaboratively read French song texts, sharing written comments on the texts with their classmates. The comments can then be downloaded in XML format.

As part of a joint research project, Jim Law, Rachel Poulin, and David Barny analyzed these student comments. This research was determined to be exempt from IRB review, protocol number 2018-05-0092.
